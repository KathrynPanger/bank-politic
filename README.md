# Python Challenge: Accessing and Manipulating Data

## Summary:
Using only basic python commands, this code will extract target data, perform basic operations on them, and report the findings.


## The Files:
Pybank folder:
* Resources folder
    *csv file containing data on profits and losses by month from a fictional bank (budget_data.csv)
* Analysis folder
    *Text output of final analysis (pybank_output.txt)
    *Python code used to analyize data (main.py)
* Bonus folder
    * Perform the tasks associated with the pypoll dataset using more advanced python commands (pypoll_bonus.py)
    * Perform the tasks associated with the pybank dataset using more advanced python commands (pybank_bonus.py)
    * Ouptut of pypoll_bonus (pypoll_bonus.csv)
    * Output of pybank_bonus (pybank_bonus.csv)
